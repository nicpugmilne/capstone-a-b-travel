**Problem statement:**

When planning a trip without clear criteria (ie. event at specific date, time, location for minimum duration) it can be difficult to research and keep track of various options. Every time I’m planning a trip I find myself trying out a different note taking or spreadsheet solutions to be able to make decisions on what the best itinerary would be and it’s always so painful. 

Example of the decisions I’m trying to make: Researching flight options to try find the cheapest route or dates, but once you add the extra cost of additional hotel nights or ground transportation (train or bus etc) it might not be cheaper anymore.
